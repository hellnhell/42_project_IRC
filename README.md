# 42_project_IRC

Internet Relay Chat or IRC is a textual communication protocol on the Internet. It is
instantaneous communication mainly in the form of discussions in groups via discussion
channels, but can also be used for one-to-one communication.
IRC client programs connect to an IRC server to access a specific channel. IRC servers
are connected between them to provide a global network with unique channels.
In this project we create our own IRC server tested with a real IRC client.

### Usage
  * Make && ./irc-server [port]
  * Make && ./irc-server [port] [password]
  * Connection with : nc/telnet localhost [port] or Textual Irc client.
